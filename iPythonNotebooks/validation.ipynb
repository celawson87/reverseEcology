    "\n",
    "We believe that reverse ecology metrics are sensitive to genome completeness. We also observed that--for a single tribe--at least four SAGs or MAGs were required before the pan-genome was \"complete\", based on single-copy marker genes. Because we only have four genomes for two tribes, we cannot confidently perform reverse ecology analysis at the tribe-level. At the clade level, we have 12 genomes from clade acI-A, 21 from clade acI-B, and 3 from acI-C. This should allow us to make confident predictions about the differences between the acI-A and acI-B clades.\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to map metatranscriptome samples to the \"pan-genome\" of each clade. To construct the pan-genome, we used our reference genome collection to define actinobacterial COGs (clusters of orthologous groups), and defined the pan-genome of a clade as the union of all COGs present in at least one genome. To obtain the pan-genome sequence, we aligned all sequences belonging to each COG and obtained a consensus sequence for each COG. We then mapped a number of metatranscriptomes to each consensus genome and looked for differentially expressed genes."

If a clade has a unique such compound, I anticipate the genes to be expressed, as this compound represents a unique aspect of the clade's niche, and allows it to avoid competition.
